## ⚙️ Installation & Setup


1️⃣ Create a Python Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
# macOS / Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


🔑 API Credentials Setup


1) Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).

2) Create a new app.

3) Set the Redirect URI to:
https://www.google.com
⚠️ This is an important step — without it, authentication will fail.

The first time you call a tool from this server, you will be asked to authorize Spotify.
After logging in, copy the redirected URL from your browser and paste it into the terminal when prompted.

Done! 🎉
