## Overview

Klavis Guardrails is a comprehensive security layer designed to protect MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations from emerging threats. It operates as an intelligent proxy between MCP clients and servers, providing real-time threat detection and policy enforcement.

## The Security Challenge

MCP's architecture amplifies security risks by exposing tools, resources, and prompts directly to AI agents. Recent vulnerabilities demonstrate critical flaws:

- **Prompt Injection via Tool Descriptions**: Malicious instructions embedded in MCP tool metadata
- **Cross-Repository Information Leakage**: Agents coerced into accessing private repositories  
- **Command Injection and RCE**: Basic security flaws allowing arbitrary code execution
- **Credential Theft**: MCP servers storing OAuth tokens become high-value targets

## Security Architecture

Klavis Guardrails operates as a security proxy that intercepts, analyzes, and enforces policies on all MCP communication in real-time with four key protection mechanisms:

**Tool Poisoning Detection**: Monitors MCP tool metadata using behavioral analysis to identify when tools deviate from declared functionality.

**Prompt Injection Prevention**: Uses advanced NLP to analyze prompts for malicious instructions, detecting sophisticated attacks before they reach the model.

**Privilege Escalation Monitoring**: Enforces granular access controls ensuring MCP servers operate under least privilege principles.

**Command Injection Mitigation**: Performs deep inspection of tool invocations with strict allowlists and input sanitization.
