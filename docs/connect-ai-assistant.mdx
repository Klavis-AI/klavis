Integrate Klavis with your AI development workflow and coding assistants.

Klavis provides LLM-accessible tools that you can plug locally in your coding assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, etc.). There are multiple options:

- **An MCP server** that can directly query this documentation and access Klavis tools, ensuring your coding assistant receives real-time information about available commands and features.
- **Direct API integration** using our REST API endpoints for programmatic access
- **SDK integration** using our Python or TypeScript SDKs
- **Copy-paste documentation** for quick context sharing

Alternatively you can also use the native AI assistant built into this documentation portal.

## Option 1: Install the MCP server

Open a terminal and run the following command to install the Klavis MCP server locally:

```bash
npx @klavis/mcp-server
```

This will set up the MCP server that allows your AI assistant to:
- Query Klavis documentation in real-time
- Access available MCP server tools
- Get up-to-date API reference information
- Interact with Klavis services directly

Everything will be set up automatically with proper authentication and configuration.

## Option 2: Use the REST API

Integrate Klavis directly into your AI workflows using our REST API:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.klavis.ai/servers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The API provides access to:
- MCP server management
- Tool execution
- OAuth authentication flows
- Real-time server status

Get your API key from the [Klavis Dashboard](https://www.klavis.ai/home).

## Option 3: SDK Integration

### Python SDK

Install the Python SDK:

```bash
pip install klavis
```

Use it in your Python applications:

```python
from klavis import KlavisClient

client = KlavisClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
servers = client.get_servers()
```

### TypeScript SDK

Install the TypeScript SDK:

```bash
npm install @klavis/sdk
```

Use it in your TypeScript/JavaScript applications:

```typescript
import { KlavisClient } from '@klavis/sdk';

const client = new KlavisClient({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
const servers = await client.getServers();
```

## Option 4: Copy-paste documentation context

For quick context sharing, you can copy relevant documentation sections directly into your AI assistant's prompt. Key sections include:

- [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) - Complete API documentation
- [MCP Server Quickstart](/documentation/mcp-server/github) - Individual server setup guides  
- [AI Platform Integrations](/documentation/ai-platform-integration/overview) - Platform-specific integration guides

## Option 5: Use the documentation's built-in assistant

This documentation portal has a built-in AI assistant. Simply click "**âœ¨ Ask AI**" at the top of any page to use it. The assistant has access to the complete Klavis documentation and can help you with:

- Setup and configuration questions
- API usage examples
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Best practices and recommendations

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your integration method** based on your use case
2. **Get your API key** from the [Klavis Dashboard](https://www.klavis.ai/home)
3. **Follow the quickstart guide** for your chosen platform
4. **Test the integration** with a simple API call or tool execution

For detailed setup instructions, see our [platform-specific guides](/documentation/ai-platform-integration/overview).
