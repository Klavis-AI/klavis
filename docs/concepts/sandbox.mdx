## The Problem

For LLM researchers, setting up LLM training or reinforcement learning environment for real-world tool use is complex and painful:

- Managing different environment or test accounts
- Implementing MCP Servers and handling various authentication issues
- Initializing realistic data
- Resetting states between multiple runs
- Ensuring isolation across concurrent sessions

## The Solution

Klavis MCP Sandbox as a Service solves these challenges. In addition to letting your model interact with our comprehensive MCP server ecosystem, you can use our sandbox infrastructure to easily **dump and reset data** on any concurrent run.

<Info>
Our sandbox infrastructure is **horizontally scalable**, so it can handle any number of concurrent sessions as you need.

## Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create">
    Request a sandbox based on the external services you need (Snowflake, Gmail, CRM, ERP, etc.) and get an MCP server URL for that isolated instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize (seed)">
    Load a deterministic "world state" in JSON format. We handle everything—creating databases, setting up CRM data, ERP systems, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interact (MCP)">
    Let your LLM / AI agent use MCP tools against the sandbox as if it were the real app. You can use multiple MCP servers with many tools simultaneously.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dump (verify)">
    Snapshot the full sandbox state to programmatically compare against your ground truth—whether your LLM completed the task correctly or not.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reset / Delete">
    Wipe the sandbox back to a clean slate and kick off the next run.
  </Step>
</Steps>
