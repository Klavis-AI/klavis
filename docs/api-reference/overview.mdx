The Klavis API is built on REST principles. We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.

## API Structure

**Standard Server:** `https://api.klavis.ai`

**EU Residency Server:** `https://api.eu.klavis.ai`

<Tip>
  For EU, Klavis website will be [https://eu.klavis.ai/](https://eu.klavis.ai/)

## Response codes

Klavis uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, 2xx HTTP codes correspond to success, 4xx codes are for user-related failures, and 5xx codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 200    | Successful request.                     |
