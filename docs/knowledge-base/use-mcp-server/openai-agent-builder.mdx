    />
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Your Trigger Node">
    When you create a new workflow, the **'Start'** node will already be present on your canvas. This foundational node defines your workflow inputs through the `input_as_texts` variable.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate Strata with Your AI Agents">

    <img
      src="/images/knowledge-base/openai-agent-builder/step7.png"
      alt="Add New Agent"
    />

    Drag the **"Agents"** node from the core nodes section onto your canvas. Configure it with the following settings:
    
    **Basic Configuration:**
    - **Name:** Strata (recommended)
    - **Instructions:** You are a helpful assistant.
    - **Tools:** Select **"MCP Server"**

    <img
      src="/images/knowledge-base/openai-agent-builder/step8.png"
      alt="Choose Strata as MCP Server"
    />
    **MCP Server Details:**
    1. **URL:** Paste your Strata URL from Step 2
    2. **Label:** `strata`
    3. **Description:** Strata by Klavis AI _(optional)_
    4. **Authentication:** Select **"None"**
    5. **Approval:** Select **"Never"**

      alt="Adding Strata as Agent"
    />


  </Step>

  <Step title="Add User Approval Node">
    Drag and drop the **"User Approval"** node onto your workflow canvas. This node adds a human-in-the-loop checkpoint, pausing execution until a user approves or rejects the proposed action.

    <img
      src="/images/knowledge-base/openai-agent-builder/step10.png"
      alt="User Approval node"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Final Step">
    To finalize your workflow:
    1. Duplicate the **"Strata"** agent node
    2. Connect the duplicated node to the **"Approve"** output of the User Approval node
    3. Connect the **"End"** node to the **"Reject"** output
