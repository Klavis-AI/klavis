This guide walks you through the process of setting up a LinkedIn OAuth application for authentication and API access.

## Prerequisites

- A LinkedIn personal account
- A LinkedIn company page (required for app creation)

## Step 1: Create a LinkedIn Developer Account

1. **Go to LinkedIn Developer Portal**: Visit [https://developer.linkedin.com/](https://developer.linkedin.com/)
2. **Sign in**: Use your LinkedIn personal account to sign in
3. **Accept Developer Agreement**: Review and accept LinkedIn's Developer Terms

## Step 2: Create a New Application

1. Click **"Create App"** on the developer portal
2. Fill out the application form:
   - **App name**: Choose a descriptive name for your application
   - **LinkedIn Page**: Associate with your company's LinkedIn page (required)
   - **App logo**: Upload a logo (recommended 100x100px PNG)
   - **Legal agreement**: Check the box to agree to LinkedIn's API Terms of Use

<Note>
Make sure you have admin access to the LinkedIn company page you're associating with your app.
</Note>

## Step 3: Configure OAuth Settings

1. Go to the **"Auth"** tab in your application dashboard
2. **Add Redirect URLs**:
   - For development: `http://localhost:8000/oauth/linkedin/callback`
   - For production: `https://yourdomain.com/oauth/linkedin/callback`
3. Click **"Add redirect URL"** for each URL you need

<Warning>
Redirect URLs must match exactly what you configure in your application. LinkedIn is strict about URL matching.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Request Product Access

1. Navigate to the **"Products"** tab
2. Request **"Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect"**:
   - Click **"Request access"**
   - Fill out the use case form explaining how you'll use LinkedIn authentication
   - Submit for review (usually approved within 24-48 hours)

<Tip>
Be specific about your use case when requesting product access. LinkedIn reviews these requests to ensure compliance with their API policies.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Get Your Credentials

Once your application is approved:

1. Go to the **"Auth"** tab
2. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Store these securely in your application's environment variables:
   ```bash
   LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

## Next Steps

After setting up your LinkedIn OAuth app:

1. **Test your OAuth flow** in development environment
2. **Implement proper error handling** for OAuth failures
3. **Review LinkedIn's rate limits** and API usage policies
4. **Monitor your app's usage** through the developer portal

## Common Issues

- **Redirect URI mismatch**: Ensure your redirect URLs exactly match what's configured in LinkedIn
- **Product access pending**: Some LinkedIn products require manual approval which can take 1-2 business days
- **Company page access**: You must be an admin of the LinkedIn company page to create apps
